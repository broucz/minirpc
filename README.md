MINI-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol. Inspired by the [JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification), this implementation written in Rust selected its essential parts in order to keep as minimal as possible the communication between processes.
